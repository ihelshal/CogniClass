<h2> Focusing Performance </h2>
<p>
  I used only Transfer Learning models in this project to get faster and better results.
  For Emotion Recognation:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>VGG16,</li>
  <li>VGG19,</li>
  <li>ResNet,</li>
  <li>Inception,</li>
  <li>Xception,</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I experimented with transfer learning models. I used the Xception model in this section because it gives the best result.

If you want to run real-time Focusing Performance, create a folder named 'DataTest' and add your video. Then, run the FocusingPerformance.py script.

```python
python FocusingPerformance.py
```
